### PyBer_Analysis

## Overview of the Analysis
The goal of this activyty was to get information of the ridesharing in all different types of cities around the United States. This visualization of data, would help us to understand the difference each type of city in the statistics of total of rides, total of drivers, the avg fare, the avg fare per drive, etc. This final results, will give us a perspective of where people pay more for rides, where driver earn more, and this will help us to develop recommendations to attack the disparities that are faced in each city type. 

## Results

The results shown with the information we obtained, show a big disparity among city types, with the people living in rural cities as the most affected ones.

1) With this table, we can see that in Rural and Suburban cities there are more rides than drivers, contrary in Urban cities where are more drivers than rides. 
2) With the first point explained, we can see that the avarage fare per ride and driver, are different in every city type. As the universal rule of supply and demand says, if there is more supply than demand, pries will be lower, and otherwise if there is more demand than supply, prices will be higher. We can viualize it by seeing the avg fare per ride and driver.

With this line chart we can observe the seasonality of the Total Fares by City Type. For obvious reasons, Urban will have the highest Total Fare, then will go Suburban, and Rural will have the lowest. 

We can see than in Jan, there is a decrease in rural fares, and Suburban and Urban have a little upgrade on the fares. In the final days of Feb, we can see that all the city types have a peak, but the first days of March it comes down, except for Urban Cities. 

## Summary 
I would have 3 recommendations based on the results, and based on the supply and demand law. 

1) Balance the drivers according to the rides in each city type: 
  - Get more drivers in Rural and suburban cities. 
2) Send some drivers from Urban Cities, to Suburban and Rural Cities. 
3) In the high demand season of Urban Cities, get some drivers from Suburban and Rural Cities. 

With this recommendations, I expect that the disparity of the fares by city type will standarize, and rural and suburban customers will get a fair fare.
